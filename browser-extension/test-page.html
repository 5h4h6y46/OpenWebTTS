        <h1>OpenWebTTS Browser Extension Test Page</h1>
        
        <p>
            Welcome to the OpenWebTTS browser extension test page! This page contains various types of text content
            to help you test all the features of the extension, including paragraph reading, heading detection,
            and word-by-word highlighting.
        </p>

        <h2>About Text-to-Speech Technology</h2>
        
        <p>
            Text-to-speech (TTS) technology has revolutionized how we consume written content. From helping individuals
            with visual impairments to allowing multitasking while learning, TTS has become an essential accessibility
            tool in the modern digital age.
        </p>

        <p>
            OpenWebTTS takes this technology a step further by providing a completely open-source, privacy-respecting
            solution that runs entirely on your local machine. Unlike cloud-based services that track your reading
            habits and upload your documents, OpenWebTTS ensures your data never leaves your computer.
        </p>

        <h2>Key Features to Test</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <strong>Testing Instructions:</strong> Click the OpenWebTTS extension icon in your browser toolbar,
            then click "Read Page" to have this entire page read aloud with real-time highlighting.
        </div>

        <h3>1. Paragraph Reading</h3>
        
        <p>
            The extension should seamlessly read through paragraphs like this one, highlighting each sentence as it
            reads. Notice how the highlighting follows along with the spoken words, making it easy to track where
            you are in the text.
        </p>

        <h3>2. List Reading</h3>

        <p>Here are some benefits of using OpenWebTTS:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Completely free and open source with no hidden costs or subscriptions</li>
            <li>Privacy-first design that keeps all your data local and secure</li>
            <li>Multiple voice engine options including Piper, Kokoro, and Coqui</li>
            <li>Customizable reading speed from half-speed to double-speed</li>
            <li>Word-by-word highlighting with multiple color themes to choose from</li>
            <li>Works offline without requiring an internet connection</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Ordered Lists</h3>

        <p>Follow these steps to get the best experience:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Ensure your OpenWebTTS backend is running on localhost:5000</li>
            <li>Install the browser extension following the installation guide</li>
            <li>Open the extension popup and verify the connection status shows green</li>
            <li>Navigate to any webpage with text content you want to read</li>
            <li>Click the "Read Page" button or select specific text for targeted reading</li>
            <li>Adjust settings like speed and highlighting colors to your preference</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Advanced Features</h2>

        <blockquote>
            "The power of open source lies in its accessibility and transparency. OpenWebTTS embodies these principles
            by providing enterprise-grade text-to-speech capabilities to everyone, completely free."
        </blockquote>

        <div class="test-section">
            <h3>Selection Reading Test</h3>
            <p>
                Try selecting just this paragraph with your mouse, then click "Read Selection" in the extension popup.
                The extension should read only the selected text, ignoring everything else on the page. This is perfect
                for reading specific sections without having to listen to the entire document.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>

        <p>
            The OpenWebTTS extension uses several advanced techniques to provide the best reading experience. The content
            script intelligently extracts readable text from web pages, filtering out navigation menus, advertisements,
            and other non-essential content. It focuses on main paragraphs, headings, lists, and blockquotes.
        </p>

        <p>
            For highlighting, the extension implements a two-tier system. First, it highlights the entire sentence being
            read with a subtle background color at 25% opacity. Then, as the audio progresses, it highlights individual
            words with a more prominent 65% opacity. This creates a smooth, easy-to-follow reading experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Performance Optimization</h3>

        <p>
            Behind the scenes, the extension caches audio files to avoid regenerating the same content multiple times.
            It uses efficient DOM manipulation techniques to minimize impact on page performance. The highlighting system
            is powered by CSS classes that are applied and removed dynamically as words are spoken.
        </p>

        <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

        <p>
            Text-to-speech technology serves many important purposes beyond convenience. For individuals with dyslexia,
            visual impairments, or other reading difficulties, TTS can be a transformative tool. It can help with
            comprehension, reduce eye strain, and make consuming written content more enjoyable.
        </p>

        <p>
            The visual highlighting feature adds an extra layer of accessibility by helping users track along with
            the audio. This multi-sensory approach (hearing + seeing) can improve comprehension and retention,
            especially for complex or technical content.
        </p>

        <h2>Supported Voice Engines</h2>

        <p>
            OpenWebTTS supports multiple TTS engines, each with its own strengths:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Piper:</strong> A fast, high-quality neural TTS engine that works completely offline</li>
            <li><strong>Kokoro:</strong> An alternative engine with excellent voice quality and emotional expression</li>
            <li><strong>Coqui:</strong> Perfect for voice cloning, allowing you to create custom voices</li>
            <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Cloud-based option for users who prefer cutting-edge AI voices</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Customization Options</h2>

        <p>
            The extension provides extensive customization to suit your preferences. You can adjust the reading speed
            anywhere from 0.5x (slow and deliberate) to 2.0x (quick skim reading). The chunk size determines how much
            text is processed at once, with smaller chunks providing more frequent pauses.
        </p>

        <p>
            Highlight colors can be changed to match your preference or mood. Choose from yellow (classic), green
            (easy on the eyes), blue (calm and focused), pink (vibrant), or orange (energetic). The auto-scroll feature
            keeps the currently reading section centered on your screen automatically.
        </p>

        <h2>Privacy and Security</h2>

        <p>
            One of the key advantages of OpenWebTTS over commercial alternatives is its commitment to privacy. All
            processing happens locally on your machine. The text you read never gets uploaded to external servers
            (unless you specifically choose to use cloud-based voices like OpenAI).
        </p>

        <p>
            Your reading history, preferences, and document content remain completely private. There's no tracking,
            no analytics, and no data collection. You have full control over your information at all times.
        </p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            The OpenWebTTS browser extension brings powerful text-to-speech capabilities to your everyday web browsing.
            Whether you're reading articles, documentation, research papers, or just catching up on news, the extension
            makes it all more accessible and convenient.
        </p>

        <p>
            Best of all, it's completely free, open source, and respects your privacy. Give it a try on this page
            or any other website, and experience a new way of consuming written content. Happy reading (or listening)!
